At the end of my first year of study in computer science (Première année de BTS / First BTS year) I had to do an internship during 6 weeks.

The company were I worked is:
Name: IS Decision
Location: Bidart, Izarbel Technology Park (Technopôle in french), Bask Country

The main activity of the company is to work on a Windows account protection software named UserLock.
The goal is to allow companies to deploy an UserLock server so as to protect users' windows account with a multi-factor protection.

More info about UserLock here: https://www.isdecisions.com/fr/userlock/docs

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My work during this internship:

Develop an extension of UserLock in C# that allows UserLocks' servers administrators to manage their UL server.
My project was named as "ULTerm".
Overall, my goal with this project was to understand how UserLock works and connect to UL API so as to establish the connection with my project.

#/!\ I am not allowed to show the code for this project for confidentiality reasons /!\

As following the sentence above, I'll just send a couple screenshot of what I've done without showing anything related to the company of course.




Here is a first screenshot, showing the connection status to the server:
(For exemple here, I typed the command "-x" which will show every UL PowerShell (1) commands so as to manage an UL environment)

Here is what's displayed when you mistyped the command to ULTerm (syntax error):
NB: The screenshot right below, is the only code I left in this repository since it's just displaying strings.

#HELP TABLE:

(1) UL PowerShell: A bunch of PowerShell commands developped by IS Decision so as to manage various stuff on a UL Server. 
I'm not revealing anything more, since I'm not allowed to tell more than that.


The only thing I could add is that a few months after my internship, I've been told that my project has been successfully added to UserLock. It was a pleasure for a first professionnal experience in a company.
